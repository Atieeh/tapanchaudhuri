            Professor Tapan K. Chaudhuri, MD, FACP, FACNM, specialized in the
            application of nuclear physics in medicine and spiritualism, and
            earned his medical degree from the University of Calcutta.
            <br />
            <br />
            He received his training in nuclear medicine from Yale University
            and the University of Iowa.
          </p>
          <p class="t">
            After serving as Assistant Professor of Radiology at the University
            of Iowa and as Associate Professor of Internal Medicine at Eastern
            Virginia Medical School (EVMS), he became a full professor of
            radiology at EVMS.
            <br />
            <br />
            His research centered around radionuclide methods to diagnose
            patency of tear duct after surgery and to assess bladder dysfunction
            in case of prostate enlargement; early diagnosis of complications of
            diabetes affecting the stomach, gallbladder, and urinary bladder;
            and the effects of various drugs on stomach emptying.
          </p>
          <p class="t">
            He has authored and co authored roughly two hundred publications in
            various national and international medical and scientific journals,
            including several book chapters.
            <br />
            <br />
            He served our nationâ€™s heroes, military veterans, as the Chief of
            Nuclear Medicine at Hampton VAMC and taught nuclear medicine to
            residents and medical students of EVMS for nearly forty-one years.
            <br />
            <br />
            He chaired scientific sessions and presented papers at international
            conferences in Moscow, Glasgow, and Paris.
            <br />
            <br />
            In addition to his achievement in materialistic science, he also
            studied and learned spiritual science under a spiritual guru. Some
            of the contents of his book, Electromagnetic Energy of the Human
            Mind: Physics of the Mind, came from his knowledge and wisdom
            acquired after seeing the lights of heaven and hearing the voices of
            God in his near-death experience during twenty-one days of coma
            resulting from septic shock of a severe small-pox infection.
